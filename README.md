## Welcome to the Stand by Me world: 
an oddly shaped planet with imperceptible borders where every resident,at the age of 16 years old, leave his/her homes and families to face extraordinary adventures and challenges with their superpowers.
This scenario applies daily to boys and girls leaving the alternative care system and that are asked to face and cope with the challenges of autonomy earlier than their peers.
This free and downloadable game is an awareness and critical thinking tool about autonomy and growing up, built through
a participative process thanks to the Stand by Me European project. The game applies to boys and girls but also to the adults going along with them.
